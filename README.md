# DCTSample
DCT (discrete cosine transform) Calculation for image processing (blur detection)

This is a sample project with functions that 
1. Create a matrix from an image (each value represents the luminance of that pixel)
2. Calculates a DCT matrix from an image matrix
3. Calculates an inverse DCT matrix (for testing purposes)

This is a starting point for image processing in Swift.
